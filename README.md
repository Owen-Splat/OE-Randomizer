# OE-Randomizer
A randomizer for the Octo Expansion DLC for Splatoon 2

## Information
This randomizer includes options for randomizing weapons, levels (including the 4 thangs needed to progress to the final stages of the story), ink color, and music. An additional option exists for a One-Hit KO "Enemy Ink Is Lava" challenge

With weapons randomized, every level is given 3 choices regardless of how many are in the vanilla level. Additionally, the first choice is left vanilla to ensure every playthrough is able to be completed
